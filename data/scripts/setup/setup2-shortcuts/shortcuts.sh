# Clear the macOS keyboard shortcuts that get in the way, starting with F11.
#
# Show Desktop is two shortcuts, not one: 36 is the key combination and 37 the
# bare function key an Apple keyboard sends. Clearing only 36 leaves F11 still
# sweeping every window aside, which reads as the setting not having worked.

# ── Why this does not use `defaults write -dict-add` ──────────────────────
#
# The obvious command is:
#
#   defaults write com.apple.symbolichotkeys AppleSymbolicHotKeys \
#     -dict-add 36 "{ enabled = 0; value = { parameters = (65535, 65535, 0); }; }"
#
# and it half works, which is worse than failing. That value is an old-style
# ASCII plist, a format with no number type at all — every unquoted token in it
# becomes a *string*. macOS stores parameters as ("65535", "65535", "0"), does
# not recognise the triple that means "no shortcut", and the key keeps working.
#
# So the plist is exported, edited with `plutil -replace -json` (which does have
# types), and imported back through `defaults`. Going through `defaults` rather
# than writing ~/Library/Preferences directly matters too: cfprefsd caches that
# file and will happily overwrite an edit made behind its back.
