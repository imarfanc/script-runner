# Two kinds of permission:
#
#   PROMPTS   macOS shows a dialog when the script touches the thing. Triggering
#             it is the whole job; the answer is remembered per app.
#   PANES     macOS has no API to ask. The script opens the right System
#             Settings pane, waits for you, then re-checks.
#
# Add to either list to cover more — the format is described above each one.
